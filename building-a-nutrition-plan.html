    It is entirely possible to create a diet plan that allows you to gain,  maintain,
    or lose weight while improving your overall health. The  guide below
    simplifies some key concepts to give you the knowledge needed  to create a
    personalized diet plan.
</p>
<p>
    Note: I am not providing a sample diet plan here because there is no
    one-size-fits-all solution. Instead, I encourage you to use this  knowledge
    to create your own diet, while tracking your macronutrient  and caloric
    intake and monitoring your weight and body composition. This will ensure that
    you end up with a diet tailored to your unique body and goals.
</p>
<p>
    The objective of this guide is to help you to:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            Create a diet plan that will improve and maintain your health.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Enable you to reach your body weight and composition goals.

<h2>
    Concepts
</h2>
<p>
    <strong>What Foods Should We Eat?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    It’s a lot simpler than you’d think. Only eat what is natural,  that is,
    foods that have been available for hundreds of thousands of  years: meats,
    vegetables, fruits, seeds, and nuts. These are the  foods our bodies have
    evolved to digest.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What foods should we Avoid?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Anything not in that list above.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Why Avoid Grains?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    While grains can be found in nature, humans only started farming  and
    consuming them around 5,000 years ago, after the agricultural  revolution.
    Our bodies have not since evolved to consume them.
    There’s a reason they are cheap foods - they contain  anti-nutrients, cause
    blood sugar spikes, and have little nutritional  value. They place undue
    stress on the body, often leading to  long-term damage. Common health issues
    like obesity, acne, diabetes  and other diseases are tied to this dietary
    shift.
</p>
<p>
    It should be evident that your body is better adapted to consuming  foods
    that align with our natural environment: fruits, vegetables,  nuts, seeds,
    and meats.
</p>
<p>
    Consuming grains and processed foods overloads your body with  toxins,
    prevents healthy nutrients from entering your body, weakens  your immune
    system and making you more susceptible to viruses and  infections.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What About Dairy?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Dairy can be found in nature, but is intended for baby cows. It  contains
    cow hormones and is typically pasteurized (heated), which  denatures fats
    and makes them unhealthy.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Food Quality</strong>
</p>
<p>
    By eliminating refined and processed foods like sweets, candies,  and
    grains, you’ve already taken a significant step toward a  healthier diet. To
    further improve, focus on eating:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Organic foods (where possible)
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Antibiotic-free meats
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Non-GMO produce
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>What About Vegan/Plant-Based Meats?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    While not exactly natural, vegan meats are often easier to digest  than
    traditional meats – and that’s a wonderful thing. My recommendation would be
    to include them in your diet regularly. Just watch out for those
    that contain grains. I do recommend plant-based milks and protein powders
    over dairy 100% of the time.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Balancing Macronutrients</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You should aim to incorporate proteins, fats, carbs, and vitamins into each meal to ensure
    a well rounded diet.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
            <strong>Examples of Proteins:</strong> Eggs, chicken, fish,
            pea protein, tofu
    </li>
    <li>
            <strong>Examples of Fats:</strong> Avocado, walnuts, pecans,
            Brazil nuts
    </li>
    <li>
            <strong>Examples of Carbohydrates:</strong> White rice, white
            potatoes, sweet potatoes, all fruits
    </li>
    <li>
            <strong>Examples of Vitamin-Rich Foods:</strong> Vegetables,
            fruits
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Vitamins</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Take a daily multivitamin to supplement any nutritional gaps in  your diet,
    as modern foods often lack essential nutrients.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Protein Intake</strong>
</p>
<p>
    My recommendation based on years of experience and self-research.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
            0.5g/lb of body weight for those not engaged in fitness
            training.
    </li>
    <li>
            Up to 0.75g/lb of body weight for those involved in fitness
            training, whether trying to gain or lose weight. I find that more
            than that is excessive and hard on the kidneys.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>What Should I Drink?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Water - preferably spring water. No surprises there.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Gaining or Losing Weight</strong>
</p>
<p>
    There is no universal recommendation for caloric intake. Everyone  has a
    different body weight and metabolic rate. Begin by weighing  yourself every
    morning and taking an average over three days. Track  your average weight,
    and adjust your diet every couple of weeks based  on your goals.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
            To <strong>gain weight</strong>, add more meals or increase
            portion sizes. Gaining more than 1-2 lbs per week is mostly fat and
            not recommended.
    </li>
    <li>
            To <strong>lose weight</strong>, ensure you are not losing
            more than 1-2 lbs per week, as rapid weight loss will also result in
            muscle loss.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>What about Detoxing... is it Healthy to Fast?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Yes, when done safely. Fasting allows your digestive system to rest and
    has tremendous health benefits. It should be done with caution - please
    research safe practices before planning a fast.
</p>

<h2>
    Final Note
</h2>
<p>
    You’ll find a lot of conflicting advice online, much of it even  coming from
    food manufacturers and government agencies. The best  approach is to ask
    yourself: Is this a natural food? How does it make  me feel? Sticking to a
    healthy diet takes willpower and commitment,  but saying "no" to short-term
    pleasure and “yes” to the  fuel that your body needs is the path to a long,
    healthy life.
