                I've been passionate about health and fitness since the age of 18, experimenting with bodybuilding and powerlifting alongside
                various cardio regimens and sports, as well as diets and healthcare protocols, in order to have a strong and healthy physique for an improved quality of life. I enjoy the feeling of a good workout, and find happiness in sharing my learnings and experiences with others.

					<strong>Building a Nutrition Plan</strong>
					<br />
It's easy to overcomplicate nutrition, but in this article I'll show that it's actually very simple to have a healthy diet, using research and personal experience to explain which foods our bodies do best with, and how to create a plan that allows you to hit your goals - whether weight loss, maintenance, or gain, while improving your health.
